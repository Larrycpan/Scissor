# Scissor: Single-Cell Identification of Subpopulations with bulk RNA-Seq phenotype cORrelation #

`Scissor` is a novel single cell data analysis approach. By leveraging bulk data and phenotype information, Scissor automatically selects a subset of cells from the single-cell data that is most responsible for the differences of phenotypes through a graph-regularized sparse regression model.
